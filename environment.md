# Environment variables

Main goals:

- different variables for different binary
- allow secrets to be but in a file, instead of an environment variable or a command line parameter
- command line parameters should override environment variables
- there's no need for a public key (file or environment variable): this can be derived from the secret key
- each binary allow environment to be automatically loaded (and overridden) from an `.env` file
- hbbr/hbbs should be able to run from ENV only (plus DB for hbbs), cli args only, `.env` file only, or a mix

Notes:

- `HBBS_SECRET_KEY` and `HBBS_SECRET_KEY_FILE` are mutually exclusive. The program will stop for configuration error if both are specified.
- `HBBS_SECRET_KEY` (or `HBBS_SECRET_KEY_FILE`) is required unless `HBBS_ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED=1` or `HBBS_ALLOW_ANY_KEY=1` is specified
- `HBBS_SECRET_KEY` should be a valid key (`-` is not allowed, `-` is not allowed)
- `HBBS_SECRET_KEY_FILE` should refer to a file containing a valid key (`-` is not allowed, `-` is not allowed)
- `KEY` should be a valid key or `-` or `-`
- `HBBS_DB_FILE` is required. The destination file is created if not already present.

## error logging

It is possible to specify different logging level for both programs, by setting `RUST_LOG` in this way: `RUST_LOG=hbbr=warn,hbbs=off`.

## some clarification needed

- (hbbr) What is the difference between blacklist.txt and blocklist.txt? And why is this not used in hbbs?
- (hbbs) What is the meaning of the environment variable `TEST_HBBS`? There's only a comment saying "temp solution to solve udp socket failure". I understand that this can be an IP address (maybe the external IP of the server when natted), but it keeps failing for me with "Error: invalid socket address syntax"
- (hbbs) What is the meaning of the command line argument "--software-url"? I understand that if I set like "--software-url=http://somedomain.com/something-44", then the calculated version is "44", but where is this information used?
- (hbbs) There are some other command line arguments that are unclear (to me): `--local-ip`, `--mask`.
- (hbbs) What is the meaning of the environment variables `PORT_FOR_API` and `KEY_FOR_API`?
- (hbbs) Is `MAX_DATABASE_CONNECTIONS` needed?
- (hbbs) What is the meaning of `--rendezvous-servers`?

## other ideas

Previous environment variables should generate a deprecation warning message in the log.
It's also a good idea to indicate in which version the varibale will be removed (next major release?).

There's no specific log configuration, the only option is setting the `RUST_LOG` variable; this has to be improved. One idea is to differentiate log levels for the two binaries, another is to add an option to log to a file; this should cover the vast majority of cases.

Instead of using `blacklist.txt` and `blocklist.txt`, we can use a database. Maybe the same database we use for hbbs.

Is the `.env` file really necessary? It can create confusion with docker-compose.
